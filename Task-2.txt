TASK-2
QUESTION: Write a blog on the differences between document and window objects.

ANSWER:

DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS:
      
        The window object is related to the window that gets loaded into the browser first. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight,
name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

        The document object is the html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has 
properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
 
 In order to access a property for the window, it is:  
                                          window.property
 In order to access a property for the document, it is:
                                           window.document.property or simply document.property

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS:

                             Window object                                                                                Document object

1)It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.        1)It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
2)It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.                                2)It is loaded inside the window.
3)It is the object of the browser                                                           3)It is the object of the window property.
4)Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.  4)All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
5)We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window                         5)We can access the document from a window using the window.document
6)The window is part of BOM(Browser object model), not DOM(document object Model)           6)The document is part of BOM and DOM.
7)Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.                7)Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also
                                                                                              be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
8)syntax:                                                                                   8)syntax:
          document.propertyname;                                                                         window.propertyname;
9)example:                                                                                  9)example:
     document.title :  will return the title of the document                                       window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser.
